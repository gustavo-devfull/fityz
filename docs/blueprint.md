## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) for a gentle and inviting feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) providing a subtle and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale rose (#FFB9B9) to highlight calls to action and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to deliver a clean and modern feel.
- The layout of the page is visually clean and airy. Use generous whitespace. Give different page sections slightly different background treatments (alternating the shade of grey). Sections should not run into each other; each one should have a clearly delineated purpose.
- Use subtle animations with easing for transitions and effects. Strive for a polished feel. Animation must always serve the user experience, not detract from it. Animation should not occur unless triggered by a user action.
- Use icons consistently, focusing on clarity. Keep icon style in harmony with chosen typography.
